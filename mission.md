## Our Missions

Create decent and fair working conditions for all workers around the world

## Core Behaviors

This is influened by Patreon's [culture](https://patreonhq.com/how-to-build-culture-that-lasts-dc25b086cefd)


### Be Transparent

We believe transparency is the key to creating decent working conditions and true information flow is the only way to improve the lives of people around the world.  This is why all our code, trello boards, marketing campaigns, pitches are open and free for anyone to collaborate on or share.

### Be Positive

This stuff is hard and the conditions can be depressing or shocking but instead of focusing on the negative, we like to look at the bright side, push for changes in a positive way.  This means we __do not shame__ consumers or companies to make changes, we don't want to __exploit workers__ for marketing purposes.  We want consumer and corporate behaviors to change based on transparent data and they believe it is the decent thing to do.

### Be Business-minded

We believe that the only way to make this is work is to create a viable business model to support these efforts.  This means both for us and companies want to improve their workers conditions.  If it doesn't improve their sales, cut costs, improve productivity, etc, then its not as useful.  In the end, for us to be successful, companies have to be successful.

A concept similar is what Give and Take refers to as "otherish", givers who help others but also make sure to take care of their own interests so they can sustain their efforts.
